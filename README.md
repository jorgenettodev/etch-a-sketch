## **About the Project**

This project is a digital **Etch-A-Sketch** created as part of _The Odin Project's_ JavaScript course. The project helps reinforce core JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, event listeners, and CSS styling. Users can "draw" by hovering over a grid of squares, similar to the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy, with customizable grid sizes and drawing modes.

## **Features**

- Interactive grid where users can "draw" by hovering over cells.
- Adjustable grid size to increase or decrease drawing resolution.
- Clear button to reset the drawing.
- Toggle between different drawing modes:
  - **Black mode**: Draw in black.
  - **Rainbow mode**: Draw in random colors for each hover.
  - **Eraser mode**: Erase by hovering over drawn squares.

## **Built With**

- **HTML5**: Defines the structure of the Etch-A-Sketch grid and layout.  
- **CSS3**: Adds styling for the grid and control buttons, including responsiveness.  
- **JavaScript**: Handles DOM manipulation to create and interact with the grid, manage different drawing modes, and implement custom features.

## **Getting Started**

To run the Etch-A-Sketch project locally, follow the steps below.

### **Installation**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jorgenettodev/etch-a-sketch.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd etch-a-sketch
    ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser:
    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```
    Or drag and drop the `index.html` file into your browser.

### **Usage**

1. Select your preferred **grid size** using the provided controls to adjust drawing precision.
2. Start drawing by moving your cursor over the grid.
3. **Drawing Modes**:
   - **Black Mode**: Default mode to draw in black.
   - **Rainbow Mode**: Draw with a random color for each cell hover.
   - **Eraser Mode**: Erase content by hovering over cells to restore the grid's background color.
4. Click the **Clear** button to reset the entire grid.
5. Change grid size dynamically and start fresh if needed.

## **Roadmap**

Ideas for future improvements:
- Add additional drawing tools such as fill or custom brush sizes.
- Allow users to save and export their creations as an image file.
- Implement smooth transitions and animations for grid interactions.
- Add a color picker for a custom drawing mode.
